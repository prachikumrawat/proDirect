Outsole lugs are raised slightly under the forefoot for enhanced grip and comfort at toe-off.Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners craving a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock.

Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability - all in one layer - was refined. The result is a featherweight, form-fitting and virtually seamless upper.Flywire helps provide ultra-lightweight support and comfort for your foot. It gets its strength from thin nylon fibers strategically placed on the upper of the shoe to hold the foot in place, helping to reduce slippage during activity.
