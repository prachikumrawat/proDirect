As a result, it's incredibly lightweight, with a precision fit that feels like a second skin. It's no wonder the world's best marathon runners are wearing it in competition.The one-piece knit upper seamlessly integrates areas of high support, breathability and stretch where you need them most—without overlays, which add weight. For an adaptive fit, lightweight dynamic Flywire wraps the foot and is adjustable through the laces.A Nike Zoom unit in the forefoot offers low-profile, ultra-responsive cushioning. The full-length, compression molded Phylon midsole provides even more lightweight impact protection.The waffleskin rubber outsole features a racing-specific diamond pattern, delivering lightweight durability and traction. Outsole lugs are raised slightly under the forefoot for enhanced grip and comfort at toe-off.Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners craving a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability - all in one layer - was refined. The result is a featherweight, form-fitting and virtually seamless upper.Flywire helps provide ultra-lightweight support and comfort for your foot. It gets its strength from thin nylon fibers strategically placed on the upper of the shoe to hold the foot in place, helping to reduce slippage during activity. This allows for a massive reduction in weight because material is used only where it’s needed for structure.Due to high demand, order are limited to one per customer.",http://www.prodirectrunning.com//productimages/V3_1_Main/149003.jpg,http://www.prodirectrunning.com//productimages/V3_1_Gallery_1/149003.jpg,12,5

As a result, it's incredibly lightweight, with a precision fit that feels like a second skin. It's no wonder the world's best marathon runners are wearing it in competition.The one-piece knit upper seamlessly integrates areas of high support, breathability and stretch where you need them most—without overlays, which add weight. For an adaptive fit, lightweight dynamic Flywire wraps the foot and is adjustable through the laces.A Nike Zoom unit in the forefoot offers low-profile, ultra-responsive cushioning. The full-length, compression molded Phylon midsole provides even more lightweight impact protection.The waffleskin rubber outsole features a racing-specific diamond pattern, delivering lightweight durability and traction. Outsole lugs are raised slightly under the forefoot for enhanced grip and comfort at toe-off.Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners craving a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability - all in one layer - was refined. The result is a featherweight, form-fitting and virtually seamless upper.Flywire helps provide ultra-lightweight support and comfort for your foot. It gets its strength from thin nylon fibers strategically placed on the upper of the shoe to hold the foot in place, helping to reduce slippage during activity. This allows for a massive reduction in weight because material is used only where it’s needed for structure.Please note due to high demand, orders will be limited to one per customer.",http://www.prodirectrunning.com//productimages/V3_1_Main/62857.jpg,http://www.prodirectrunning.com//productimages/V3_1_Gallery_1/62857.jpg,13,5

The fabrics are engineered with yarns that are built to have a hollow core, allowing higher amounts of air to be trapped, which provides for greater insulation without adding additional weight.The fibres along with the unique fabric knit construction provide advanced moisture control, wicking sweat away from the body and transporting to the front of the fabric. The moisture is then spread out to a wider surface area that ensures that the moisture dries quickly through evaporation.Lastly, the plus weaved material, which utilises special cross-shaped pockets on the inside of the garments, help to create an adaptive microclimate, preventing the soaking of the textile whilst at the same time locking-in body heat for high level of heat retention and added moisture control.",http://www.prodirectrunning.com//productimages/V3_1_Main/115276.jpg,http://www.prodirectrunning.com//productimages/V3_1_Gallery_1/115276.jpg,8,5

As a result, it's incredibly lightweight, with a precision fit that feels like a second skin. It's no wonder the world's best marathon runners are wearing it in competition.The one-piece knit upper seamlessly integrates areas of high support, breathability and stretch where you need them most—without overlays, which add weight. For an adaptive fit, lightweight dynamic Flywire wraps the foot and is adjustable through the laces.A Nike Zoom unit in the forefoot offers low-profile, ultra-responsive cushioning. The full-length, compression molded Phylon midsole provides even more lightweight impact protection.The waffleskin rubber outsole features a racing-specific diamond pattern, delivering lightweight durability and traction. Outsole lugs are raised slightly under the forefoot for enhanced grip and comfort at toe-off.Nike Flyknit technology was inspired by feedback from runners craving a shoe with the snug (and virtually unnoticed) fit of a sock. Nike embarked on a four-year mission with teams of programmers, engineers and designers to create the technology needed to make the knit upper with static properties for structure and durability. Then the precise placement of support, flexibility and breathability - all in one layer - was refined. The result is a featherweight, form-fitting and virtually seamless upper.Flywire helps provide ultra-lightweight support and comfort for your foot. It gets its strength from thin nylon fibers strategically placed on the upper of the shoe to hold the foot in place, helping to reduce slippage during activity.
